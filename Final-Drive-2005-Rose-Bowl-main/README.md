# Final Drive

Final Drive is a C++ console-based football game inspired by a late-game drive scenario.

## Overview

The game places the player in control of a quarterback during a single high-pressure drive, requiring quick decisions while managing downs and the clock.

The experience is inspired by a historic moment but is simplified and fictionalized.
